GeometryWarsClone
=================

A [Geometry Wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Wars) clone made in Java and [LWJGL](http://www.lwjgl.org/), and uses [BMFont](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) for fonts.

This hasn't been worked on in two years, I'm just uploading it so it's easier to access.
